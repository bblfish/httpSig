/**
 * SignatureVerifier is a function that verifies that a signing string is signed
 * by the signature in bytes.
 * (There are many algorithms to verify a signature but this trait abstracts them all.)
 * This goes beyond a simple function though: it is Object Oriented in the CoAlgebraic sense,
 * in that it gives back the observation of the identity of the Agent as a String identifier.
 * This is only secure if the KeyId is tied to the signature proof.
 *
 * @returns a verified keyid, if the signature is good, or a failure explaining the problem.
 *          the implementation of Keyid can contain more informaiton than the keyid but must contain
 *          at least that.
